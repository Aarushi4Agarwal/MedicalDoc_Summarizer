Background: Sharing experiences and learning from health measures taken during the
outbreak of epidemics is a critical issue that affects the right and timely decisions in health
crises. In the present study, an attempt has been made to review the health policies adopted
against COVID-19 and extract critical points for resolving the epidemic crisis.
Materials and Methods: This article was a comparative study. The study population comprised
Canada, Japan, Germany, Korea, Turkey, and Iran. Ten effective indicators in the management
of epidemics were extracted by reviewing the literature and interviewing disaster management
experts, and the degree of conformity of the research community with them was examined.
The study data were collected from articles published in scientific databases (Google Scholar,
PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus search engines) or information from COVID-19 disease
management organizations from official sites. The obtained data were processed and analyzed
by matrix content analysis.
Results: The results showed the importance of 10 effective indicators in the management
of epidemics during the outbreak of COVID-19 studied and noticed by the health system
of most countries. And the government, local and private organizations have participated in
the implementation of the studied indicators according to the conditions of each countryâ€™s
health system. Therefore, the success rate of countries in managing COVID-19 disease varies
according to the time, type, and manner of implementation and monitoring of measures.
Conclusion: Speed of action in adopting health policies and integration in its implementation,
construction of convalescence, adequate training and access to personal protective equipment,
prevention of nosocomial contamination, and voluntary assistance are essential issues in
the fight against epidemics. These measures should be considered and used as teachings in
managing health crises, especially emerging diseases and pandemics.
